# Student-Loan-Prepayment-Prediction-with-xgboost
This project focus on hyperparameter tuning in the context of student loan prepayment prediction using the xgboost package. Which includes analysis in: 

1. Determine feature importance and also the directional relationship between each variable and the probability of prepayment. For the three most important features, give an intuitive explanation for the directional relationship.

2. Choose three hyperparameters for the XGBClassifier, and tune them independently using expected-balance, accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Use 3-fold crossvalidation for all three metrics. Explain what you think the optimal value is for each of the hyperparameters. Include graphs in your explanation.

3. Use GridSearchCV to do an exhaustive grid search to find the optimal combination of the three hyperparameters. Use accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC as your scoring metrics. Use 3-fold cross validation.

4. Compare results from tuning each hyperparameter independently versus using the grid search.

5. Check the 5-fold cross validation expected-balance and ROC-AUC for the optimal hyperparameter combination found with GridSearchCV.
